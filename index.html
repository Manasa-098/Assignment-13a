    <p class="text">Kohli was averaging 106 in the last 5 chases in T20's before this match. And today, after an injured
        Yuvraj
        laboured to 21 and was dismissed by Faulkner in the 14th over in this Ind vs Aus World T20 encounter, it was
        over to captain (Dhoni) and vice-captain. With 39 required off 18 deliveries, it seemed like a hairy end
        approaching. The next 13 balls read 4 4 6 2 1 2 0 4 4 4 0 4 4. Dhoni played only 2 of these and scored 6
        including the winning boundary. Kohli sunk to the ground as the ball crossed the boundary - a departure from the
        usual punch in the air and raised bat celebration - testifying how this chase had tested his temperament, still
        he managed to come out on top.

    <h1>Early Life</h1>
    <img src="virat.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p class="text1">The youngest among three siblings, Kohli was born in Delhi and had a passion for cricket from an
        age
        of just
        three. He would often play gully cricket and it was then that the neighbours suggested that Kohli should get
        professional training. It was around this time, in the year 1998 that West Delhi Cricket Academy was formed
        and Kohli was among one of the first students there. Kohli was not only good in cricket, he was an excellent
        student and is admired by his teachers.</p>

        <img src="virat3.webp" alt="" class="img0">
        <p class="text">In 2008, Kohli was taken in the Indian Cricket ODI team for the tour of Srilanka and the
            Champions Trophy to Pakistan. He scored his first fifty in the fourth match, at an age of 19. Kohli was
            taken as a replacement for an injured Shikhar Dhawan for the unofficial test tour to Australia where he
            batted once and scored 49. In 2008, during India’s England tour, although Kohli was a part of the team, he
            did not get a chance to play in the team due to the presence of Tendulkar and Sehwag. He was also selected
            in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament in Australia in 2009 where his performance impressed the
            world.<br>
            Kohli however, earned the tag of an ODI player due to his high run rates and was not thought to be a Test
            player by the experts of cricket. He proved everybody wrong when he made 132 in the test tour of Australia,
            2011.
